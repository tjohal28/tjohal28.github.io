                <p>Hi! My name is TJ Johal and I am currently a graduate student at UC Berkeley.</p>
                <p>I am originally from the East Bay Area, born in Hayward, CA and resided in Fremont, CA.</p>
                <p>I have an undergraduate degree from the University of San Francisco in Finance.
                Living in San Francisco is probably the greatest time period of my life so far 
                because of how great of a city it is, despite what other people like to say about it. 
                I highly recommend living there in your early 20s if you are looking into moving to the Bay Area. </p>
                <p>Some things about me are that Drake and J. Cole are my favorite artists, the Harry Potter
                    series are my favorite movies of all time, my favorite foods are pizza and birria tacos
                    and I love hanging out with friends in my free time.</p>
